# loquacious
Website project in progress =^._.^=

**Feel free to check out the live BETA site here: https://loquacious.xyz/**
**OR check out the Github (static) version, as it gets updated a lot more: https://truddytheduddi.github.io/loquacious/**

(Tho I still need to figure out how to link it to the hosting site so it updates automatically...)

## What will I be working on?
First of all, I'm going to focus on the designs and layouts. That means, all of the content you'll be seeing is merely **placeholders** for now. So if you see some wacky text or interesting content, then there's no need to worry

Watch out! The documents are currently **not mobile optimized**. And since the design is pretty complex, it might turn out looking really messed up.

Here's a list of the pages, and the amount of progress or each of them:
* Profile pages (70%)
* Profile settings (20%)
* Single post vizualiser (80%)

That's all for now! Have a cookie: :cookie:
