# loquacious
Website project in progress =^._.^=
![Hellooo](https://github.com/TruddyTheDuddi/loquacious/blob/master/katto.gif)

## What will I be working on?
First of all, I'm going to focus on the designs and layouts. That means, all of the content you'll be seeing is merely **placeholders** for now. So if you see some wacky text or interesting content, then there's no need to worry =^.w.^=

Here's a list of the pages, and the amount of progress or each of them:
* Profile pages
* Settings
